## 🚀 What is HealthMate?

**HealthMate** is more than a voice assistant—it’s your **trusted health confidant** that *thinks and reasons like a clinician* to deliver safe, reliable medical knowledge. Designed to empower everyone, especially underserved communities, it provides instant, ethical health guidance through voice interaction, bridging gaps in health literacy and accessibility.

- 🎙️ **Voice-First Queries**: Ask health questions naturally, no typing required.
- 🧠 **Reasoned Responses**: Simulates clinical reasoning for clear, evidence-based answers.
- 🌍 **Global Impact**: Targets rural, low-literacy, and non-English-speaking users.
- 🚨 **Ethical Core**: Never diagnoses, always escalates emergencies, and refers to professionals.

> 💡 Imagine a medical mentor in your pocket—available 24/7, powered by AI, and grounded in trust.

## ⚙️ How HealthMate Works

### 🧭 System Workflow

HealthMate’s brilliance lies in its ability to *think and reason* like a clinician, ensuring every response is safe, accurate, and helpful. Here’s the flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[User Speaks Query] --> B[LiveKit: Streams Audio]
  B --> C[AssemblyAI: Speech-to-Text]
  C --> D[RAG + LLM Reasoning Engine]
  D --> E[ChromaDB: Vector Database]
  E --> F[Clinical Reasoning Layer]
  F --> G[Safe, Ethical Voice Response]
```

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

| Step | Component       | What It Does                                                   |
|------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|

## Core Logic: LiveKit + AssemblyAI + Gemini LLM

**Purpose**:  
Enable real-time voice streaming, detect end-of-speech (VAD), convert voice to text via AssemblyAI, and route the transcription to Gemini via FastAPI backend.

### Key Components

```python
# Set up LiveKit Voice Activity Detection + AssemblyAI
stt = assemblyai.STT(
    api_key=ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY,
    end_of_turn_confidence_threshold=0.7,
    min_end_of_turn_silence_when_confident=160,
    max_turn_silence=2400,
)
```

```python
# Define LLM function to call FastAPI's /api/query
def webhook_llm_function(prompt: str) -> str:
    response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/api/query", json={"query": prompt})
    return response.json().get("answer", "No answer received.")
```

```python
# LiveKit Agent Setup
llm = FunctionLLM(func=webhook_llm_function)

agent = Agent(
    name="HealthMate Voice Agent",
    session_factory=lambda: AgentSession(
        stt=stt,    # Real-time transcription
        llm=llm,    # Calls backend for Gemini response
        tts=None    # No text-to-speech (yet)
    ),
)
```

## Challenges Faced & How We Solved Them

| Challenge            | Description                                                                 | Solution                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Voice Cutoff Timing | User speech was getting cut too early or too late.                          | Tuned `end_of_turn_confidence_threshold` and silence timings in AssemblyAI. |
| Audio Sync          | Voice stream sometimes lagged between LiveKit and AssemblyAI.               | Optimized buffer settings and ensured proper threading in voice stream. |
| Slow LLM Response   | Gemini API responses created noticeable lags in conversation.               | Implemented loading states on frontend and added response caching.       |
| CORS Errors         | Frontend couldn’t connect to FastAPI backend due to CORS policy blocks.     | Used `fastapi.middleware.cors` with permissive settings during dev.      |
| API Key Leaks       | Accidentally committed `.env` with secrets.                                 | Added `.env` to `.gitignore` and rotated all leaked API keys immediately. |
